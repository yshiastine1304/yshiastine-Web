      <h3>Portrait Artist</h3>
      <p>Returning after an art hiatus is a fresh start for my passion. It may be hard at first on how to start but new ideas, styles and inspirations made me continue my art journey. At that time I only drew cartoons, but now he's into drawing portraits using graphite pencil, charcoal and oil. I realized that art is too important to forget me and my talent.
